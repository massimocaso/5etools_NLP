        "- Il nostro progetto si focalizza sull'uso di un modello di Natural Language Processing (NLP) pre-trained per analizzare descrizioni delle classi di Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) presenti in file specifici. Implementiamo un sistema di Question and Answering (Q&A) che consente agli utenti di porre domande sulle informazioni delle classi e ricevere risposte accurate, introduciamo inolte anche la traduzione automatica dall'inglese all'italiano.Il processo coinvolge l'impiego di modelli di recupero e di lettura, insieme a tecniche di embedding per migliorare la comprensione del contesto e fornire risposte pi√π precise."
